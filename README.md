# Helix Exchange Practical Test Project

Welcome to the Helix Exchange Practical Test Project! This documentation outlines the architectural choices and technologies used in this project, aimed at showcasing the powerful capabilities of the selected stacks.

## üöÄ Frontend Stack

The frontend of this project is meticulously crafted using a robust combination of Next.js, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS was chosen for its unparalleled utility-first approach, offering incredibly flexible and open-handed styling capabilities. Its ease of use significantly accelerates the development process, allowing for rapid UI creation and consistent design across the application.

### Shadcn UI

Shadcn UI stands out for its magnificent optimizations specifically tailored for Next.js. It provides a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and highly performant components built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. This integration ensures a cohesive and visually appealing user interface with a strong emphasis on performance.

### Next.js

Next.js forms the foundational layer of the frontend, demonstrating its versatile rendering capabilities:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages are dynamically generated on the server for each request, ensuring up-to-date content and improved SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pages are pre-rendered at build time, resulting in blazing-fast load times and excellent performance for static content.
- **Blazing Fast Abilities**: By leveraging both static and dynamic generation on the server, the project achieves remarkable speed and responsiveness.
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**: Data can be fetched directly on the server, passed as props to components, and then used to render the complete page before sending it to the user.

Throughout different parts of this test project, various Next.js capabilities have been strategically utilized to showcase its full potential and adaptability for diverse use cases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Stack

The backend is powered by a reliable and high-performance stack comprising Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

### MongoDB & Mongoose

While other database options like SQLite were available, MongoDB was chosen due to extensive prior experience and comfort, enabling quicker development. MongoDB is a magnificent NoSQL database, well-suited for a variety of use cases, offering robust features such as:

- **Atomic Transactions**: Ensuring data integrity even in complex operations.
- **Replication**: Providing high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data and traffic.

Integrating Mongoose within a TypeScript environment provides a bulletproof, type-safe API stack. Mongoose's schema-based modeling for MongoDB ensures data consistency and provides powerful query capabilities, enhancing development efficiency and reducing potential runtime errors.

### Express

Express.js was selected for its exceptional speed and minimalist nature. Being a bare-bones framework, it grants full control over the application's backend logic, allowing for highly customized and optimized solutions. Its flexibility makes it an ideal choice for building robust APIs.

### API Architecture

The API architecture is meticulously designed with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in mind, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase. The logic is clearly separated into:

- **Routes**: Defining the API endpoints and directing requests.
- **Controllers**: Handling business logic and preparing data for responses.
- **Services**: Encapsulating reusable business logic and interacting with the database.

This separation of concerns significantly improves maintainability, enhances code reusability, and facilitates seamless scaling of the application as it grows.
