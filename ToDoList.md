# ToDoList: Helix Exchange Project Progress

This document provides an overview of the accomplished features and potential enhancements for the Helix Exchange Practical Test Project. It aims to showcase the current state of development and highlight areas for future improvements, acknowledging the time constraints during the initial build.

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

The following features and optimizations have been successfully implemented on the frontend, demonstrating a strong foundation and adherence to design principles:

- **Category Browser**: A comprehensive interface for browsing various categories.
- **Collection to User Browser**: Functionality allowing users to explore collections.
- **Item Visualizer**: A detailed view for visualizing individual items.
- **Charts Across Item and Collection**: Interactive charts providing insights into item and collection data, utilizing mock data to illustrate capabilities.
- **Pixel-Perfect Figma Implementation**: The UI largely adheres to the provided Figma design, ensuring a high-fidelity visual experience.
- **Custom Icon Components**: Multiple custom icon components have been created to perfectly match the Helix design language specified in Figma.
- **Universal Error Handling**: A robust system for handling and displaying errors gracefully across the application.
- **Universal Loading Handling**: Consistent loading indicators and states to improve user feedback during data fetching.
- **Universal Not Found Handling**: Dedicated pages or messages for handling non-existent content or routes.

### Extensive Optimization Showcases:

- **Image Optimization**: Implementation of techniques to ensure images load efficiently.
- **Server-Side Fetching**: Demonstrations of data fetching on the server for enhanced performance.
- **Static Page Generation (SSG)**: Examples of pre-rendered pages for blazing-fast load times.
- **Dynamic Page Generation (SSR)**: Showcasing on-demand page generation for dynamic content.
- **Modular Component and Architecture Design**: Pages and components have been developed with modularity in mind, promoting easy maintenance and fostering reusability across the application.
- **Numerous Detail-Oriented Implementations**: Many other minor yet crucial details have been addressed to ensure a polished and functional product.

## üõ†Ô∏è What Can Be Done (Future Enhancements)

While the project delivers a strong core, the following areas represent opportunities for further refinement and expansion, acknowledging the focused effort required within a limited timeframe:

### Mobile View Optimization:

- Easily achievable with more dedicated time, the current focus was primarily on delivering a pixel-perfect desktop experience according to the Figma design.
- Certain sections, such as item grids, collection grids, headers, the collection analyzer, and individual item pages, are already partially optimized. However, full comprehensive adjustment for optimal mobile viewing remains a key area for future work, as this was considered an optional enhancement during the initial phase.

### More Customized Components for Helix-Specific Design:

- While significant effort was invested in creating multiple custom components and icons using the provided Figma assets, further customization can be pursued.
- Additional time would allow for the development of even more bespoke components to completely align all aspects of the UI with Helix's unique design style, filling any remaining gaps where deeper customization might enhance the brand identity.

## üíª Backend Implementation

The backend of the Helix Exchange project is built with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and robust API design.

- **MVC Architecture**: An MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture has been implemented for the server environment, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and a structured approach to development. This promotes better organization, easier debugging, and improved team collaboration.
- **Data Models**: Multiple test models have been implemented for various data entities, providing a solid foundation for data structuring and interaction.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: A RESTful API has been implemented using Node.js (v18+) with Express and TypeScript. The design adheres to a modular folder structure, where each domain (e.g., collections, items, listings, offers, and auth) has its own dedicated route, controller, and service module. This modularity ensures separation of concerns and greatly enhances scalability.

### Resource Handling:

Following pragmatic REST principles, specific endpoints are exposed per resource:

- `/collections`
- `/items`
- etc.

Each endpoint supports query parameters for advanced filtering, pagination, and optional fetching by ID or specific attributes (e.g., `/items?id=123`, `/offers?userId=abc`). Deeply nested routes have been avoided unless strictly necessary, favoring query-based filtering to keep endpoints general yet flexible, allowing for easy expansion without creating numerous route variations.

### Authentication & Security:

- **Bcrypt Hashing**: Bcrypt hashing is used for password storage, ensuring robust security for user credentials.
- **JWT Tokens**: A simple email + password authentication system has been implemented with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). These tokens are signed with a secret key, and routes requiring authentication are protected by middleware that verifies the JWT.
- **Future Hardening**: This initial implementation focuses on demonstrating the pattern over full production hardening. Future enhancements could include features like refresh tokens and password reset functionalities.
